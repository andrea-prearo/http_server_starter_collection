# Rust HTTP Server Starter

A minimalistic Rust HTTP server app using [Rocket](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket) and [Serde](https://serde.rs).

## Running locally

Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) installed.
The code has been developed and tested using `nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin - rustc 1.20.0-nightly (622e7e648 2017-06-21)`.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:andrea-prearo/http_server_starter_collection.git
cd http_server_starter_collection/rust_http_server_starter
cargo run
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

You can terminate the app by pressing `Ctrl+C`.
