# Ruby HTTP Server Starter

A minimalistic Ruby HTTP server app using [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra).

## Running locally

Make sure you have [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) installed.
The code has been developed and tested using `ruby 2.3.0`.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:andrea-prearo/http_server_starter_collection.git
cd http_server_starter_collection/ruby_http_server_starter
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec ruby app.rb
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567).

You can terminate the app by pressing `Ctrl+C`.
