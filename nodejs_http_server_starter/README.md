# Node.js HTTP Server Starter

A minimalistic Node.js HTTP server app using [Express](http://expressjs.com).

## Running locally

Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed.
The code has been developed and tested using `node v7.2.1`.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:andrea-prearo/http_server_starter_collection.git
cd http_server_starter_collection/nodejs_http_server_starter
npm install
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can terminate the app by pressing `Ctrl+C` and then `a`.
